Dr. Sarah Johnson, a 42-year-old cardiologist at Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), 
published a research study on 3 September 2024. The study examined 1,250 patients 
with hypertension across Lagos, Abuja, and Port Harcourt.

The project was funded by the World Health Organization (WHO) and supported by 
the Nigerian Ministry of Health. Dr. Johnson collaborated with Dr. Michael Adeyemi 
and a US-based researcher, Prof. Emily Clark from Harvard University.

The study found that 67% of participants were unaware of their blood pressure levels, 
and 35% had a family history of cardiovascular disease. Recommendations were submitted 
to the Ministry on 15 October 2024, with plans for nationwide screening starting January 2025.
